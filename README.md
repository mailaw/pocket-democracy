# Pocket Democracy
Pocket democracy was ideated as an augmented reality experience that allows a user to get information about names on their ballot by scanning it with their smartphone, revealing relevant information, popular news links, and a sentiment analysis of articles relating to the candidate. Pocket Democracy also supports speech-to-text and text-to-speech recognition and processing.

This repo holds our web applcation prototype that was adapted from an IBM Watson Discovery News starter kit. It uses the data we gathered from images of a ballot using Google Cloud Vision and python to query the IBM News RSS feed.

Prototyping & build tools:
Google Cloud Vision’s Optical Character Recognition API
Google Cloud’s Text-to-Speech API
IBM Watson’s Discovery News API
RevSpeech’s Speech-to-Text API
